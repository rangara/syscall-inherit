1. User program to list existing vectors.
   --> ./listVectors

2. Default syscall_table
   --> ./logging

3. Show error when prohibited syscall is overwritten.
   --> insmod vector_prohibit.ko

4. Forking where child inherits syscall vector from parent. show refcounts here.
   --> ./refcounting vector_refcount

5. Do not allow process to set syscall vector twice.
   --> ./setVectorOnce vector_refcount
   --> ./setVectorOnce vector_refcount vector_logging

6. Allow child to set its own syscall vector, atmost once
   --> ./setVectorOnceChild vector_refcount
   --> ./setVectorOnceChild vector_refcount vector_readonly

7. exec should work properly.
   --> ./exec vector_logging

8. Logging system calls.
   --> ./logging vector_logging

9. Snoop syscall vector.
   --> ./snoop vector_snoop (run as user "test")

10. Read-only system call vector. (example where some syscalls are blocked)
    --> ./readonly vector_readonly

11. Access control system call vector.
    --> ./accessControl vector_access (run as root)
    --> ./accessControl vector_access (run as user)

12. Parameter validation
    --> ./paramvalidate vector_params
